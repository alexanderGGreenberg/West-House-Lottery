# West-House-Lottery
This script was requeseted by Brown University's West House to speed up their lottery proccess.  It was used to pick winners
and generate a weight list for the 2018-2019 academic year.  It uses a weight system requested by the house where each
applicant is assigned a number that corresponds to how heavily they will be weighted in the lottery.  For the weighlist, all canidates will be randomized.  A special weight of 20 was requested to designate canidates who should have a 50% of being drawn no matter what, and a spot on the weight list above all canidates with weights â‰  20
